## ‚ú® About Fusion++
**Fusion++** is my own advanced fork of the original [Fusion Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMNa8mOvMCY&t=117s&ab_channel=cyde) ‚Äì a DLL-based Minecraft hack client.  
It‚Äôs built specifically for **Minecraft 1.8.9**, with improvements in:

- üß† **Bypass capabilities**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance & stability**
- üîí **Screenshare safety**

> Unlike average `.jar` clients, Fusion++ is injected as a **DLL**, making it stealthier, more reliable, and harder to detect üî•

## üíâ DLL Injection

I created a **custom injector** for Fusion++, but for ease of use, I recommend [System Informer](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/downloads) (formerly Process Hacker). It‚Äôs simple, clean, and works perfectly.

üì• **Recommended Injector**:  
[System Informer v3.2.25011 ‚Äì Download via SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/systeminformer/files/systeminformer-3.2.25011-release-setup.exe/download)
