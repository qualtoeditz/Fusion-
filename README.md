# Fusion++
🚀 My own advanced version of the original Fusion Client

I'm currently developing Fusion++, a powerful and feature-rich Minecraft 1.8.9 hack client. It's based on the original Fusion client (DLL-based), but with major improvements, better performance, and enhanced bypass capabilities.

Unlike average .jar clients, Fusion++ is injected as a DLL, making it far more stealthy and reliable—especially during screenshares or other client checks. This method provides a huge advantage in terms of undetectability and flexibility.

💉 I’ve also developed my own custom DLL injector specifically for Fusion++. However, for ease of use, I recommend using System Informer (formerly Process Hacker), which offers a more user-friendly interface.

Stay tuned for updates — Fusion++ is still in development and will only get better. 🔧✨
